This project was created for the fifth weekly assignment of CS 1501, an exercise involving third-party logging and matrix libraries. 

The project contains two classes: 
- The Wahoovian class which contains the wahoovian() function that accepts one matrix as a parameter, performs the Wahoovian Matrix Transformation* on it, and then returns the transformed matrix. 
- The Driver class which calls the wahoovian() function twice, once on a non-square matrix and once on a square matrix. 

* The Wahoovian Matrix Transformation takes a matrix and returns the same matrix transposed, with every value negated.
